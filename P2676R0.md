# Introduction

This paper presents a low-level programming model that is simple, powerful, efficient, and safe.  We
believe it could form the basis of a future safe dialect of C++.

# Motivation and Scope

Software safety is a growing and well-justified concern across government and industry, with a
recent [Linux foundation
plan](https://8112310.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8112310/OpenSSF/OSS%20Mobilization%20Plan.pdf)
specifically calling for “moving software away from C and C++ to safer languages.”  Until now,
achieving memory safety in a language like C++ has meant the use of impractical whole-program
analysis or the addition of hard-to-satisfy lifetime annotation requirements that significantly
increase API complexity.  As an alternative, we present an object model—implemented in the [Val
research language](https://www.val-lang.dev/)—based on value semantics; an idea already deeply
ingrained in C++.  It turns out that by “going all in” on value semantics, we gain three things at
once:

- Memory safety by construction
- Thread safety by construction (Rust's “fearless concurrency”)
- A simple and powerful programming model, with helpful diagnostics

As the C++ committee considers its response to the safety crisis, understanding the Val model could
allow us to arrive at a safer C++ that is also simpler.

# The Val Object Model

## Independence

The Val model starts by identifying **independence**—the idea that a mutation to one variable cannot
affect the value of another—as a key property of types with value semantics.  Independence is the true
source of the benefits functional programmers attribute to strict immutability, and of Rust's
“fearless concurrency.”

C++ supports independence in three ways:

- Pass-by-value gives the callee an independent value.
- A returned value is independent in the caller (every rvalue is independent).
- Operations such as copying and assignment can be written to avoid sharing mutable state.

Support for independence of mutable user-defined types can be traced back to Ada and Pascal, but for
30 years during the OO revolution, new reference-based language designs flooded the scene leaving
C++ in a small club (along with Swift and Rust) of popular languages with first-class value
semantics.

Unfortunately, though, C++ also *undermines* independence:

- Mutation occurs through a `this` pointer that can alias other reachable pointers and references.
- Pass-by-value eagerly copies parameters, so programmers use references as a substitute.

The key idea behind the Val model is to fully uphold independence while eliminating disincentivizing
copies.

## The Law of Exclusivity for C++ References

The use of pass-by-`const&` to mean “pass-by-value; just do it efficiently” is so ingrained in C++
practice that we do it automatically, even though it affects semantics:

::: cmptable

### Before 

```cpp
// Offsets x by 2*delta.
void offset2(BigNum& x, BigNum delta) {
  x += delta
  x += delta
}

void main() {
  BigNum x = 3;
  offset2(x, x);
  std::cout << x << std::endl; // Prints 9
}
```

### After 

```cpp
// Offsets x by 2*delta.
void offset2(BigNum& x, BigNum const& delta) {
  x += delta
  x += delta
}

void main() {
  BigNum x = 3;
  offset2(x, x);
  std::cout << x << std::endl; // Prints 12
}
```

:::

The only reasonable way to make the *After* code correct is to add an additional independence
requirement, and hope that users uphold it.

```cpp
// Offsets x by 2*delta. Requires: x and delta are distinct objects.
void offset2(BigNum& x, BigNum const& delta) {
  x += delta
  x += delta
}

void main() {
  BigNum x = 3;
  offset2(x, BigNum(x));  // Note explicit copy
  std::cout << x << std::endl; // Prints 9
}
```

Of course, independence requirements are almost never stated explicitly: in practice, there is an
unstated **Law of Exclusivity** (LoE) [@SE-0176], which requires the value of any object denoted by
a mutable reference to be independent of the values of all other variables.  We claim this law is
built into every C++ programmer's mental model, because there is no other rational way to deal with
mutation.

In fact, **the semantics of a mutating function is nearly impossible to describe unless the Law is
upheld**.  As a result of issues discovered over the course of two decades, there are
numerous examples of standard language designed to prevent specific LoE violations
(e.g. [algorithms.requirements]{.sref}/[7](https://wg21.link/algorithms.requirements#7),
[sequence.reqmts]{.sref}/[37](https://wg21.link/sequence.reqmts#37)), but looking through the
standard with the Law in mind, it is still easy to find cases like these:

::: cmptable

### Legal; undefined behavior in practice

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector v = { 0, 1 };
  std::ranges::sort(
    v, [&v](int x, int y) { 
         v.push_back(2); return y < x;
       });
}
```

### Behavior unspecified

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::vector v = { 0, 1, 2, 1, 2 };
  std::ranges::replace(v, v[1], v[2]);
  for (auto x: v) { std::cout << x; }
}
```

:::

The standard says the first one ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/xKq3onTj3)) is legal, but it causes
undefined behavior in practice. A careful reading shows that the behavior of the second
([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/vnn49YTqb)) is not specified at all.  That's not because the
standard library specification is careless, but because the general Law was never recognized.

## Parameter Passing Conventions

Val supports four parameter-passing conventions that underlie its object model.  Each can be
described either by a simple high-level semantics in terms of owned values, or mechanically in
terms of references, but with additional independence guarantees not provided by C++.


| Declaration syntax     | Semantics             | C++ mechanics         | Static guarantee/Note                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `x: let T` *or* `x: T` | pass-by-`const`-value | `T const&`            | Referent is truly immutable           |
| `x: inout T`           | borrow for mutation   | `T&`                  | Access to `x`'s value is only via `x` |
| `x: sink T`            | ownership transfer    | `T&&` (non-universal) | Callee is responsible for destruction |
| `x: set T`             | initialization        | placement `new`       | Post: `x` is initialized              |

The default passing convention is called `let`. It provides the same semantics as C++
pass-by-`const`-value, but without the disincentivizing copy. Inside the callee, `x` is an
independent value: it cannot mutate, either directly through `x` or by any other means (such as a
hidden mutable pointer or reference).

Mutation in Val is always via `inout`. An `inout` parameter is an independent value wholly owned by
the callee and only accessible via the parameter itself. This guarantee is enforced at the call site
by disallowing (potentially) overlapping accesses, thus upholding the Law of Exclusivity. *Note that
mutations in Val are marked with `&`* at the call site:

```swift
swap(&x.a, &x.b)     // OK if a and b are guaranteed distinct.
&v.remove(v[2])      // ERROR: v, being mutated, overlaps v[2]. Pass v[2].copy() instead.
swap(&x[i], &x[j])   // ERROR: x[i] and x[j] may overlap; use index_swap to ensure `i != j`.
&x.index_swap(i, j)  // OK; i == j can be checked for dynamically.
```

The `sink` convention denotes consumption of the argument; the difference from C++
pass-by-rvalue-reference is that an lvalue argument becomes inaccessible in the caller, rather than
leaving behind a meaningless shell, and responsibility for destruction passes to the callee along
with ownership of the value.

```swift
fun consume(_ x: sink Int) {}
var a = 1, b = 1
consume(a)   // OK, last use of a
consume(b)   // ERROR: b is still in use. Pass b.copy() here instead.
print(b)     // last use of b
```

In Val, the lifetime of a binding extends until its last use, so an lvalue can be sunk without any
explicit marking (such as `std::move`). A sunk argument is not actually moved in memory until and
unless it escapes the callee (i.e. is stored or returned). 

We can ignore the `set` convention for the purposes of this paper.  It is seldom used but completes
the language calculus in a way we consider valuable.  Further details at https://val-lang.dev.

## Explicit copies

You may have noticed diagnostics in the previous section that prompt the user to call `.copy()`
explicitly.  Because copies can have signficant cost, Val never copies implicitly (unless the user
explicitly opts-in with `@implicitcopy`). Because pass-by-value semantics does not imply a copy,
though, the number of explicit copies required in Val code is small. Finally, in case the idea of
explicitly copying an integer is anathema to the reader, it should be noted that explicit copies are
not fundamental to the model.

## Bindings

Bindings, which play the same role as variables in C++, have three forms:

| Declaration        | Convention | Static guarantee/Note                                                                   |
|--------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `var x = `*expr*   | `sink`     | `x` is a variable. Any lvalue *expr* becomes inaccessible forever.                      |
| `let x = `*expr*   | `let`      | `x` (and any lvalue *expr*) are truly immutable during `x`'s lifetime. No copy implied. |
| `inout x = `*expr* | `inout`    | *expr* (and anything of which it is a part) is inaccessible during `x`'s lifetime.      |

Each form can be understood as though the binding were a parameter to a continuation formed by the
code through the binding's last use, with a corresponding parameter passing convention. During the
lifetime of a `let` or `inout` binding to (part of) an lvalue, use of that lvalue is restricted as
necessary to preserve independence:

```swift
fun use<T>(_ x: T) {}

fun test(_ inout x: (first: Int, second: Int)) { // x is a tuple with two named fields.
  let y = x.first
  print(x)         // OK
  x.first += 1     // ERROR: `x.first` is `let`-bound to `y`.
  use(y)
  
  inout z = x.first
  z += 1            // OK
  print(x)          // ERROR: `x` is `inout`-bound to `z`.
  use(z)

  print(x)          // OK; `x` no longer `inout`-bound.
}
```

Because the semantics of these bindings are based on those of our parameter passing conventions,
they have the semantics of independent values, just like parameters.

## Projections: Abstracting Partwise Access

A **projection** is an abstraction for access to a part of an object.  For example, you might want
to provide read/write access to the top element of a stack. To support that sort of access without
exposing references, Val provides projections in two forms: subscripts and computed properties
(which can be thought of as subscripts without parameters).

```swift
type Stack<T> {
  var storage: Array<T> = []
  public fun push(_ x: T) inout { &storage.append(x) }
  public fun pop() -> T inout { return &storage.removeLast() }

  public property top: T {
    inout { yield &storage[storage.count() - 1] }
  }
}

fun test() {
  var x = Stack<Int>()
  &x.push(3)
  &x.push(4)
  &x.top += 1  // <====
  print(x.top) // 5
}
```

The `top` property works without exposing references by using *inversion of control*: where the
implementation `yield`s, the last element of storage is passed for mutation to a closure (lambda)
representing the mutation, which is synthesized to encode the mutation at the marked line:

```swift
  // rewritten accessor
  public fun top:inout(_ mutate: (inout T)->Void) {
    mutate(&storage[storage.count() - 1]) // Explicit inversion of control
  }
  ...
  // rewritten call site
  x.top:inout((y){ y += 1 })
```

The idea of combining inversion of control with this syntactic transformation is due to John McCall
of the Swift project.  Although it (still!) isn't part of the official Swift language, the
provisional unofficial support for it is [widely
used](https://forums.swift.org/t/modify-accessors/31872/293) for reasons that should become clear.

### Projection Accessors

Aside from an `inout` accessor, there are three other projection accessor types:

| Accessor | Meaning                                             | Result lifetime               |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `inout`  | yield a part of `self` for mutation                 | bounded by lifetime of `self` |
| `let`    | yield a part of `self` for reading                  | bounded by lifetime of `self` |
| `set`    | write to `self` without exposing the previous value | n/a                           |
| `sink`   | consume `self`, exposing a part                     | independent                   |

In the case of `Stack`'s `top` property, these accessors are all synthesized from the `inout`
accessor, but in general each one can be written separately, when there is a performance
advantage. If `inout` and `set` are omitted, but `let` is provided, the projection is immutable
regardless of the mutability of `self`.

## Projecting Synthesized Parts

The inversion of control provided by `inout` and `let` accessors allows us to project *notional*
parts that aren't actually stored anywhere in memory.  For example, this `Angle` type stores its
value in radians, but also exposes a value in degrees that can be passed `inout` like any other
mutable property:

```swift
type Angle {
  public var radians: Double
  public property degrees: Double {
    inout { 
       var d = radians * 180.0 / Double.pi
       yield &d
       radians = d * Double.pi / 180.0
    }
    set(newValue) {
      radians = newValue * Double.pi / 180.0
    }
  }
}

fun test() {
  var x: Angle(radians: Double.pi / 2)
  print(x.degrees)      // 90
  var y: Double = 180
  swap(&y, &x.degrees)
  print(x.radians)      // 3.141592653...
  x.degrees = 0         // uses the `set` accessor
  print(x.radians)      // 0
}
```

Note that if `degrees` did not have a `set` accessor, it would be synthesized from the `inout`
accessor, and the line `x.degrees = 0` would compute the existing
value in degrees, only to immediately assign over it.

Because the lifetime of `inout` and `let` projections are bound to the lifetime of the target
object, and the former are automatically “put back,” they perfectly match the use case where
resources of an object need to be temporarily and safely used elsewhere without manually managing
their lifetimes.  But use cases things more easily viewed as synthesized parts abound:

- A matrix in row-major storage can project its columns.
- Every collection `C` can have a slicing subscript that safely projects a region as a `Slice<C>`
  containing the collection itself and the region's bounds.
- A `Dictionary<Key, Value>` where keys, values, and liveness bits are stored in contiguous memory
  regions can project a writable `Optional<Value>` in response to subscripting with a `Key`, using
  only one hash lookup (a getter/setter formulation would require two).

In short, synthesized projections elegantly cover all of the cases we'd try to use proxy references,
if only they actually worked, in C++.

# Comparison with the C++ Core Guidelines

The work most closely related to Val's object model in the landscape of C++ safety is Stroustrup and Sutter's C++ Core Guidelines [@CoreGuidelines].
This project compiles best practices to "use modern C++ effectively" and safely in the form of rules enforceable through static analysis.

Type safety can be achieved by avoiding unsafe casts and type punning while bounds safety—the freedom from out-of-bounds accesses—can be achieved with cheap dynamic checks.
Lifetime safety, however, requires a more sophisticated approach.

The C++ Core Guidelines rely on an ownership discipline to reason about the lifetime of an object.
An *owner* is an object that owns another object.
For example, an instance of `std::vector` owns the elements that it contains.
An owner is responsible for the destruction of its owned object(s) and, crucially, gets the guarantee that no other object can destroy those.
These two simple rules are sufficient to prevent a large class of errors.

To keep the annotation burden at a minimum, rules have carefully designed defaults that correspond to most valid use of modern C++.
The patterns that do not fit these defaults can be expressed by user annotations.
We refer the interested reader to [@P1179R1] for the complete specification.

We note that the ownership discipline proposed by the C++ Core Guidelines upholds the Law of Exclusivity.
This observation strongly suggests that, although relinquishing reference semantics is often met with reluctance, value independence is a requirement to guarantee memory safety scalably without unaffordable run-time costs.
The fact that other programming languages, such as Rust, Pony, and Verona have come to the same conclusion gives weight to this argument.

In Val, ownership is conveyed through whole/part relationships.
For example, a vector (i.e., a dynamic array in Val parlance parlance) is naturally a composition of its elements, which denotes its parts.
A whole is responsible for the lifetime of its parts, just like an owner is responsible for that of its owned objects.
Further, mutating a whole requires its independence, just like passing an owner as an argument prevents references to its contents to be passed simultaneously.

To illustrate, consider the type declaration below, which follows the C++ Core Guidelines.
The default rules for identifying owners do not apply in this example, requiring the a user-defined annotation to declare `Matrix3` as an owner type of `double`.

```cpp
class [[gsl::Owner<double>]] Matrix3 {
  double components[9];

public:
  double& operator()(size_t row, size_t column) {
    if (row > 8 || column > 8) {
      throw out_of_range("component position out of bounds");
    }
    return components[row * 3 + column];
  }
};
```

*Note that the operator declaration is implicitly annotated by `[[gsl::post(lifetime(ret,{this}))]]` to denote the fact that the lifetime of the returned reference is bound by `this*`.*

In Val, annotations are unnecessary because the whole/part relationship between a matrix and its components can be derived from the type's declaration.

```val
type Matrix3 {
  var components: Double[9]

  public subscript(_ row: Int, _ column: Int): Double {
    inout {
      precondition((0 ..< 9).contains(row) && (0 ..< 9).contains(column))
      yield &components[row * 3 + column]
    }
  }
}
```

Without first-class pointers and references, reasoning about whole/part relationships is sufficient to achieve similar expressiveness as ownership-based approaches, only without the complexity costs of an ad-hoc ownership model.
The definition of a whole is unambiguous in a world governed by mutable value semantics.
In contrast, the definition of an owner in a world of references is orthogonal and it incumbs to the user to teach the compiler or static analyzer about the distinctions between owners and non-owners.
While the category to which a type belongs might be sometimes inferred, other cases must resort to annotations.

The C++ Core Guidelines do not claim complete memory safety and do not address thread safety yet.
Nonetheless, we are confident they can reach these goals through iterative refinements, as they take the same path as Rust, which already offers statically guaranteed memory and thread safety by construction.

Val's safe subset is almost as expressive as Rust's.
The difference lies in the fact that one cannot reassign a `let` or `inout` binding (i.e., a reference in Rust) to a different object.
We beleive this limitation has very little impact in practice, as reassignable bindings can expressed with key paths [@SE-0161].
Hence, using Rust as a proxy for a future more complete version of the C++ Core Guidlines, we can predict that Val's expressiveness is on par with the latter.

# Conclusion

- Not necessarily the answer for C++
- Syntax doesn't matter for C++
